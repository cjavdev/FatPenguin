#FatPenguin

Location based social discovery app. 

Imagine you've just graduated and you're attending a networking event to try and land a job. You walk in the room, look around, but have no idea who to talk to or what you might even say to them. Often times "breaking the ice" is the hardest part of building a network. 

Consider another scenario: You're a new mother in a new neighborhood and are interested in meeting other moms. You frequent a specific park and start to see familiar faces, but have a hard time thinking of how to initiate conversation. 

This is where FatPenguin comes in!
